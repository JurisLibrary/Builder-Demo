#Welcome to Juris!

Dear {{name}},

Our goal with Juris was to build the world's simplest open source {{document}} generation standard.

This whole {{document}} was generated from your inputs, right here in the browser. On this page you'll find everything you need to build your own. (Graphical interview builder included.)

Because we do everthing on the browser (instead of some server), we believe Juris is also the worlds most secure {{document}} generation standard. If you need to collect private personal information for a filing, no worries, you never even have to see or store that information. It never leaves the client side device.

If you have any questions please reach out to someone from the Juris community via our Discord server: https://discord.gg/SP6c6bJ

Best,
Adam
